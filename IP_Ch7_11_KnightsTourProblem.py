# Another classic problem that we can use to illustrate a second common graph algorithm is called the “knight’s tour.”
# The knight’s tour puzzle is played on a chess board with a single chess piece, the knight. The object of the puzzle is to find
# a sequence of moves that allow the knight to visit every square on the board exactly once. One such sequence is called a “tour.”
# The knight’s tour puzzle has fascinated chess players, mathematicians and computer scientists alike for many years. The upper 
# bound on the number of possible legal tours for an eight-by-eight chessboard is known to be 1.305×1035; however, there are even
# more possible dead ends. Clearly this is a problem that requires some real brains, some real computing power, or both.

# 1) Represent the legal moves of a knight on a chessboard as a graph.
# 2) Use a graph algorithm to find a path of length rows×columns−1 where every vertex on the graph is visited exactly once.
